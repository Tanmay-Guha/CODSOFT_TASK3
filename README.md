# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification

A beginner-friendly classification project using the famous Iris dataset to distinguish between three flower species.

## 📌 Objective
Train a machine learning model to classify iris species using petal and sepal dimensions.

## 🧰 Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Tree, SVM)

## 🔬 Steps
- Data visualization with pair plots & histograms
- Data preprocessing
- Model training & hyperparameter tuning
- Evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix

## 📈 Results
- Accuracy: ~97%
- Best model: KNN (98%) / SVM

## 🎓 Key Learnings
- Feature visualization is crucial in classification
- Setosa is linearly separable, while Versicolor and Virginica are not

## 📦 Dataset
[Scikit-learn’s built-in Iris dataset]
